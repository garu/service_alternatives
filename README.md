service_alternatives
====================

alternatives to existing services that you find your self using

This started out as a pirate pad (http://piratepad.net/NTi3s7kHmv)
between @vmbrasseur and my self. It was suggested (by someone far
brighter then myself) that this would make a better git repo so we can
better point to it and collect an even wider audience. Thus here it
lives! Feel free to file issues, supply support requests or even move
this all over to the wiki. For now all is fair game!
